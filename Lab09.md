## 0 Repository Structure

The typical explanation for the repo structure. Lab specific instructions can be found further below.

### 0.1 HW

The `hw` folder should contain your schematic and board files for your PCB or circuits. In labs 1-5 and 10, you will be creating schematics for your circuit in EAGLE. A setup tutorial can be found [here](https://www.shawnvictor.net/autodesk-eagle.html).

### 0.2 SW

The `sw` folder should contain your application firmware and software written for the lab. The `sw/inc` folder contains firmware drivers written for you by Professor Valvano. Feel free to write your own (in fact, in some labs, you may be required to write your own).

You can place any other source files in the `sw` folder. TAs will look at the files you create and/or modify for software quality and for running your project.

### 0.3 Resources

A couple files are provided in the Resources folder so you don't have to keep searching for that one TI document. Some of them are immediately useful, like the TM4C datasheet. Others may be useful for your final project, like the TM4C_System_Design_Guidelines page.

### 0.4 Git and Github

We will extensively use Git and Github for managing lab projects. This makes it easier for TAs to grade and help debug the project by allowing us to see commit histories, maintain a common project structure, and likewise, it makes it easier for students to collaborate with partners, merge different codebases, and to debug their work by having a history of commits.

Two common ways of using Git and Github are [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and the [command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads). [Tutorials](https://dev.to/mollynem/git-github--workflow-fundamentals-5496) are also abundant on the net for you to peruse. We've provided a cheatsheet for git in the Resources folder.

It is highly recommended to make the most out of Git, even if you've never used it before. Version control will save you a lot of suffering, and tools like Git or SVN are ubiquitous in the industry.

A gitignore file is added to the root of this repo that may prevent specific files from being tagged to the repo. This are typically autogenerated output
files we don't care about, but sometimes other stuff (like .lib files) falls through that we want. Feel free to modify if necessary.

## Summary

### Goals

1. Study ADC conversino and the Nyquist Theorem
2. Characterize the performance of the DAC and ADC
3. Encode information as a sound output from a DAC to a speaker
4. Decode information from a sound input from a microphone to an ADC
5. Develop an audio communication system

### Team Size

The team size is 4

> "FORE!!!!"
> - some golf person

### Review

1. Operation of the ADC system in the TM4C123GH6PM data sheet
2. Valvano Section 6.2 on periodic interrupts using the timer
3. Valvano Section 7.5 on SSI interfacing
4. Valvano Section 8.4 on DAC parameters and waveform generation
